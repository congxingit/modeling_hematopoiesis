# Modeling hematopoiesis

The directory contains codes and data sets for the mathematical modeling of hematopoiesis in [Morcos et al.,2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.261552v1.full). The package [Data2Dynamics](https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d) is used for computational inference. To run the model fitting, recent version of MATLB (R2016b or newer), as well as MATLAB Symbolic and Optimization Toolboxes are required.
