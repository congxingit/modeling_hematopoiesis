# Modeling differentiation pathways of hematopoiesis

The repository contains codes and data for the mathematical modeling of hematopoiesis in [Morcos et al.,2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.261552v1.full). It holds necessary files for modeling hematopoiesis in unperturbed state (subdirectory 'unperturbed'), simulated by Romiplostim (subdirectory 'TPO') and during ageing (subdirectory 'ageing').

The package [Data2Dynamics](https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d) is used for computational inference. To run the model fitting, recent version of MATLB (R2016b or newer), as well as MATLAB Symbolic and Optimization Toolboxes are required. More details of how to install and use the D2D package can be found in the [wiki page](https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d/wiki).
